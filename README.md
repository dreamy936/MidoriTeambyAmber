# MidoriTeam 🟢🚴‍♀️

Welcome to the official homepage project of **Midori**, a small cycling team born out of friendship, humor, and a shared passion for riding through Japan. 🌿

## 📌 Project Overview

This website was created with three key purposes in mind:

1. **Commemoration**  
   This is more than a site — it's a memento. Midori was formed at my very first company in Japan, alongside colleagues who quickly became close friends. Each time a new member joins (mostly recruited by Kou and me through casual offline chats), we add their avatar to this website.

2. **Photo Archive**  
   Our cycling adventures are often captured using a SONY camera, resulting in high-quality (and large) photo files. We store them in iCloud and manually select photos to showcase on the site.

3. **Event Records**  
   Both past and upcoming cycling events are listed, making it easy for members to stay updated on what's coming next.

4. **Join the Ride**  
   A "Join the Ride" button at the top right allows new users to apply for team membership by sending an email directly to the admin.

## 💻 My Contribution

Although I didn't write much of the code from scratch, I used **VS Code** and **GitHub Copilot** to generate the structure and layout. My main contributions include:

- Organizing and uploading team photos  
- Editing and updating member profiles and event details  
- Structuring the UI and fine-tuning the content layout  
- Maintaining team spirit 🎉

This project was a hands-on way for me to learn GitHub and front-end workflows while contributing something meaningful and fun.

## 🔮 Future Plans

### 🖼️ Photo Wall  
We hope to add a **photo gallery feature** where clicking an event card will open a modal or new page displaying event photos in a slideshow format.  
**Challenge:** Finding a **free backend or storage solution** to manage these images efficiently. Any suggestions welcome!

### 🗺️ Route Tracking  
We aim to integrate **Strava API** to display detailed cycling routes and stats for each ride, so members can view maps and performance data from our journeys.

## 💡 Open to Suggestions

If you have ideas on how to improve:
- image hosting or gallery display
- lightweight back-end integrations
- better member onboarding experience

Feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/dreamy936/MidoriTeam/issues) or fork the repo and experiment on your own!
